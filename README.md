🤖 JarvisAI – Voice-Activated Personal Assistant with Face Authentication
JarvisAI is a desktop-based personal assistant built with Python that integrates facial recognition authentication, voice command handling, and text-to-speech capabilities. This assistant listens for spoken commands and responds verbally, making it a hands-free and secure desktop assistant solution.

🚀 Features
🎤 Voice Recognition
Uses the Google Speech Recognition API to listen and respond to your voice commands.

🔊 Text-to-Speech
Responds using pyttsx3 to give audio feedback for a natural interaction.

🧑‍💻 Face Detection for Authentication
Before accessing the assistant, users are authenticated using real-time face detection via OpenCV and Haar Cascades.

🖥️ GUI Interface with Tkinter
Simple GUI to launch the assistant from a user-friendly interface.

📋 How It Works
User clicks the Start Jarvis button.

The webcam is activated to perform face authentication.

If a face is detected, voice interaction starts.

Jarvis listens for commands like "hello" or "exit" and responds accordingly.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 3.x

OpenCV – For webcam and face detection

SpeechRecognition – For capturing and converting voice input

pyttsx3 – For text-to-speech output

Tkinter – For GUI interface

Threading – To handle concurrent voice processing

🧪 Example Commands
Command	Response
hello	"Hello! How can I assist you today?"
exit	"Goodbye!" and shuts down the assistant


🔐 Face Authentication Notes
Uses OpenCV's Haar cascade classifier.

Webcam must be connected and accessible.

Press Q to quit face detection window if needed.

📝 To-Do / Ideas for Improvement
Add support for more voice commands

Implement face recognition (not just detection)

Add weather, reminders, or integration with online APIs

Add GUI enhancements with status feedback
